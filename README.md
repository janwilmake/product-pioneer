# **Product Pioneer** perfectly captures both aspects:

- **Product** - emphasizes they're not just experimenting or researching, but actually building tangible solutions that users will interact with
- **Pioneer** - conveys the exploration of uncharted territory and the foundational work they're doing

This term works especially well because:

1. **Clear focus**: It's immediately clear they're building actual products, not just doing R&D
2. **Market-oriented**: Suggests they're thinking about user needs and market fit, even in unexplored spaces
3. **Professional credibility**: Sounds substantial and career-defining
4. **Memorable**: Easy to remember and explain to others

**Product Pioneer** would be perfect for someone who is:

- Building the first products in emerging tech spaces (like early VR/AR apps, AI-first products, web3 applications)
- Creating entirely new product categories
- Developing solutions for problems that don't have established patterns yet

> Cloudflare could hire me for this role. I want my pioneering to happen in the open, with full commercial license to the code for cloudflare but also for me (preferable for everyone though, MIT). I want to set high-level goals with Cloudflare, these being "building an agent-friendly internet". I don't want to have to deal with product owners or something , just stakeholders being developers from other internet startups. I want to do my work with minimal private communication, if any. if we communicate, prefer to do this over github....

Here's how you could structure this proposal:

## Role Concept: **Product Pioneer - Agent-Friendly Internet**

### **Core Mission**

Building foundational infrastructure and tooling to make the internet more accessible and navigable for AI agents, with all work happening transparently in the open.

### **Operating Principles**

- **Open Development**: All code, discussions, and progress happen publicly
- **MIT Licensed**: Full commercial rights for Cloudflare, you, and the broader community
- **Developer-to-Developer**: Direct collaboration with engineers from internet startups, no traditional product management layer
- **GitHub-First Communication**: Issues, discussions, and planning happen in public repositories

### **Stakeholder Model**

- **Primary**: Developers building AI agents and automation tools
- **Secondary**: Internet infrastructure companies facing similar challenges
- **Engagement**: Through GitHub issues, public RFCs, and community discussions

### **Why Cloudflare Would Want This**

1. **Market positioning** as the infrastructure layer for the AI-agent era
2. **Developer mindshare** through open source leadership
3. **Early insights** into agent infrastructure needs
4. **Talent attraction** for developers who value transparency

### **Deliverables Examples**

- Agent-friendly API standards and documentation
- Infrastructure primitives for agent authentication/authorization, and monetization.
- Tools for agent-safe content delivery and caching
- Open protocols for agent-to-service communication

This could be positioned as a 1-2 year exploratory initiative with significant autonomy.
